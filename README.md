# Guess Game Built With Actix and ReactJS

This is an example project built with actix and ReactJS.

Algorithm:

- Pick a unique username
- Select two numbers and create a room.
- Other users can join to your room.
- Other users predicates your number.
- If someone find your selected number he/she will win the game.



# Tech stack:

- Rust (most loved language in omniverse)
- Typescript
- actix
- ReactJS (best frontend library IMO)
